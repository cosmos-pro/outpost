title: User Alerts (planned)
---

Alerts are triggered when an event fails to deliver to a destination. The `ALERT_DEBOUNCING_INTERVAL_SECOND` variable can configure alerting behavior. The debouncing interval represents the amount of time that needs to elapse for a new alert to be triggered. Alerts are scoped per destination.

Alerts support 2 types of triggers by consecutive failures or by failure rate. Destinations can be auto-disabled when the trigger is reached using the `ALERT_AUTO_DISABLE_DESTINATION` config.

Instead of implementing user-facing alerting, alerts are produced on a callback URL configured through the `ALERT_CALLBACK_URL` variable. The server does not respond with a `200` there will be an exponential backoff and log the failure. Authentication is handled using the Admin API Key via a bearer token.

It's your responsibility to format and deliver the alert to your tenant using your existing notification system.

## Consecutive failure alerts

`ALERT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_COUNT` variable will alert when the consecutive failure count reaches 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%. At 100% the destination will be disabled if the config is enabled.

```json
{
  "topic": "alert.consecutive-failure",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "max_consecutive_failures": 20,
    "consecutive_failures": 5,
    "will_disable": true,
    "destination": DestinationObject,
    "response": {
      "status": "500",
      "data": {
        "some": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Failure rate alerts

`ALERT_FAILURE_WINDOW_SECOND` and `ALERT_FAILURE_RATE` can also be used to configured alerts after certain failure rate for a certain amount of time. An alert notification will be triggered at 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% of the `ALERT_FAILURE_WINDOW_SECOND`. At 100% the destination will be disabled if the config is enabled.

```json
{
  "topic": "alert.failure-rate",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "failure_window_second": 60,
    "duration": 30,
    "max_failure_rate": 0.1,
    "failure_rate": 0.2,
    "will_disable": true,
    "destination": DestinationObject,
    "response": {
      "status": "500",
      "data": {
        "some": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
