## Event destination Types

Out of the box Outpost supports event delivery to multiple event destination types.

See [Event Destinations Types](./event-topics-and-subscriptions.mdx#event-destination-types) for more information.

## Automatic and Manual Retries

Configure retry strategies for event destinations and manually trigger event delivery retries via the API or user portal.

## At Least Once Delivery Guarantee

Messages are guaranteed to be delivered at least once and never lost.

## Webhook Best Practices

Webhook best practices, such as headers for idempotency, timestamp, signature, and signature rotation, are in place by default. You must explicitly opt-out of webhook best practices.
