title: Delivery & Retries
---

Outpost keep tracks of each event, it's status and the delivery attempts. Outpost operates on a at least-once-delivery guarantee and messages may be re-delivered. While that should be rare, the Event unique ID can be used by the consumer to deduplicate the message. 

## Automatic Retries

By default, Outpost will automatically retry events if the destination is unavailable, has incorrect configuration or if the destination returns a non-2xx HTTP response code. Automatic retries are enabled by default and the retry strategy using the environment variable `MAX_RETRY_LIMIT` and `RETRY_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

The retry interval uses an exponential backoff algorithm with a base of `2`.

## Manual Retries

Manual retries can be triggered for any given event via the [Event API](/docs/api/events#retry-event-delivery) or user portal.

## Disabled destination

If the destination for an event is disabled, through the API, user portal or automatically because an [failure threshold](/docs/features/delivery-failure-alerts) is reached, the event will be discarded and won't be retriable.

## Webhook signature & headers

For the `webhook` destination type, Outpost will automatically add the following headers to the webhook request:

- `X-Event-ID`: The unique ID of the event.
- `X-Event-Timestamp`: The timestamp of the event in ISO 8601 format.
- `X-Event-Topic`: The topic of the event.
- `X-Event-Signature`: A HMAC-SHA256 signature of the event.


To be backward compatible with your existing webhook implementation, you can change the header prefix, disable headers or customize the signature algorithm and logic. You can refer to the [migration guide](/docs/guides/migrate-to-outpost#webhook-customization) to learn more

The following environment variables can be used to customize the webhook behavior:

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Required |
|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_HEADER_PREFIX` | `x-` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_DISABLE_EVENT_ID_HEADER` | `false` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_DISABLE_SIGNATURE_HEADER` | `false` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_DISABLE_TIMESTAMP_HEADER` | `false` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_DISABLE_TOPIC_HEADER` | `false` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_VALUE_TEMPLATE` | `{{.Timestamp.Unix}}.{{.Body}}` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_HEADER_TEMPLATE` | `t={{.Timestamp.Unix}},v0={{.Signatures \| join ","}}` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_ENCODING` | `hex` | No |
| `DESTINATIONS_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_ALGORITHM` | `hmac-sha256` | No |
