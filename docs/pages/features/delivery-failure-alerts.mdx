title: Delivery Failure Alerts
---

Alerts are triggered when an event fails to deliver to a destination. Alerts are scoped per destination.

Destinations can be auto-disabled when the trigger is reached using the `ALERT_AUTO_DISABLE_DESTINATION` config.

Instead of implementing user-facing alerting, alerts are produced on a callback URL configured through the `ALERT_CALLBACK_URL` variable. The server does not respond with a `200` there will be an exponential backoff and log the failure. Authentication is handled using the Admin API Key via a bearer token.

It's your responsibility to format and deliver the alert to your tenant using your existing notification system.

## Consecutive failure alerts

`ALERT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_COUNT` variable will alert when the consecutive failure count reaches 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%. At 100% the destination will be disabled if the config is enabled.

```json
{
  "topic": "alert.consecutive-failure",

  "data": {
    "max_consecutive_failures": 20,
    "consecutive_failures": 5,
    "will_disable": true,
    "destination": DestinationObject,
    "response": {
      "status": "500",
      "data": {
        "some": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
