title: Topics
---

Outpost natively supports event topics (also know as "event types") in order to segment, filter and route events to appropriate destinations.

## Configuring Topics

A list of available topics can be configured using the `TOPICS` environment variable. If `TOPICS` is not set, Outpost will use a default of `*` to allow all values. Topics determine:

- Which topics that destinations can subscribe to.
- The valid input for the `topic` field in the [Publish Event](/docs/api/publish) API.
- The topics available via [Topic API](/docs/api/topics) & the user-facing portal.

## Destinations Topic Subscriptions

A tenant can have multiple destinations that subscribe to all or specific topics. A destination can subscribe to any number of topics. A destination topics is configured by the `topics` field in the [Create Destination](/docs/api/destinations#create-destination) API. A destination can subscribe to all topics by setting `topics` to `["*"]`.

Events published for a given tenant are evaluated against the destination's topic subscriptions to determine if the event should be delivered. A event can match 0 or many destination.

### Creating a destination with topic subscriptions

Create destinations with the following request, replacing `<TENANT_ID>` and `<API_KEY>`. The `<TYPE>` must be one of the supported [event destination types](#event-destination-types), and the `<CONFIG>` contents will depend on the event destination type.

```sh
curl --location 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>/destinations' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
--data '{
 "type": "<TYPE>",
 "topics": ["*"],
 "config": <CONFIG>
}'
```

For example, the following creates a webhook destination that subscribes to all topics (`*`) and delivers published events to the URL `https://example.test/webhooks`:

```sh
curl --location 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>/destinations' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
--data '{
  "type": "webhook",
  "topics": ["*"],
  "config": {
    "url": "https://example.test/webhooks"
  }
}'
```

## Evaluating Topics before publishing

When publishing an event, the `topic` field is evaluated against the destination's topic subscriptions to determine if the event should be delivered. Depending on your application, it's possible that the vast majority of events publish will not match any destination topic subscriptions. While that's fine, you can reduce the number of events published and uneccessary traffic by evaluating the topic before publishing. To simplify this, the [Tenant API object](/docs/api/tenants#get-tenant) contains a `topics` array that contains all the topics used across all the tenant's destinations.

If the `tenant.topics` array contains the topic of the event you are able to publish, at least one destination will match. A common pattern is to store the value of the `tenant.topics` array in your application and use it to evaluate the topic before publishing.
