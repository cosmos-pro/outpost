title: Tenant User Portal
---

The tenant can have an optional portal that lets them configure their destination. The portal supports:

- Creating and configuring a destination
- Updating or deleting a destination
- Disable or enable a destination
- Display historical events, event data and responses by status and destinations

The portal is accessed by generating a JWT from the `GET` `/:tenant_id/portal` endpoint, which returns a redirect URL with a JWT token in the URL. When the user is redirected, the JWT persists in their session storage and is used as the credential for the duration of the session.

When the portal is used, the API needs to be publicly exposed to the public internet.

The portal is a React SPA that is distributed via the API.

## Theming

The portal supports both light and dark mode which case be set through the `?theme` query param when redirecting to the portal. The portal can also be "forced" into a specific theme using the `PORTAL_FORCE_THEME` configuration option.

Additionally, the portal can be customized with an option logo either with a URL or base64 encoded 64 string.

The `PORTAL_ACCENT_COLOR` can also be used to change the primary color.

## Required Config

`PORTAL_REFERER_URL` is used to redirect the user when the JWT token is expired or when the user clicks "back".

`ORGANIZATION_NAME` is used to display the name of the organization deploying the portal.

## Design

See the [designing an event destinations dashboard guide](../../guides/dashboard-design.mdx) for more information.
