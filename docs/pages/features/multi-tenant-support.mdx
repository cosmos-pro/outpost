title: Multi-tenancy
---

Outpost supports running with a single tenant or multiple tenants on the same deployment. All resources from Destinations to Events are scoped to a tenant.

Each tenant is given a unique identifier by your application, and Outpost does not generate any tenant IDs. This enables you to use your existing application tenant IDs or generate them as you see fit.

> If your application is single-tenant, use a hardcoded value as the tenant ID, such as "default", "production", or "staging", for supporting multiple environments on the same Outpost deployment.

View the Tenant API docs [here](/docs/api/tenants).

## Creating a tenant

Create a tenant with the following command, replacing `<TENANT_ID>` with a unique identifier such as "your_org_name", and the `<API_KEY>` with the value you set in your Outpost installation `API_KEY` environment variable:

```sh
curl --location --request PUT 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```
