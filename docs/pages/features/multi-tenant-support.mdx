title: Multi-Tenant Support
---

The Outpost API supports creating multiple tenants on a single Outpost deployment.

Create a tenant with the following command, replacing `<TENANT_ID>` with a unique identifier such as "your_org_name", and the `<API_KEY>` with the value you set in your Outpost installation `API_KEY` environmental variable:

```sh
curl --location --request PUT 'localhost:3333/api/v1/<TENANT_ID>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>'
```
