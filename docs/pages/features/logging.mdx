title: Logging
---

The Outpost services will produce stdout logs based on the configured `LOG_LEVEL`. Regardless of the log level, some audit logs may need to be retained for compliance. The `AUDIT_LOG` variable can enable the production of relevant auditing logs irrespective of the `LOG_LEVEL`, such as destination configuration changes, published events, and outbound network calls.

It's the responsibility of the environment in which the Outpost services are deployed to persist and store the logs.
