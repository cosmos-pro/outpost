### Admin API Key

The API uses bearer token authentication with a token of your choice configured through the `API_KEY` environment variable.

### JWT Token

The API can also be authenticated using a per tenant token that's valid for 24 hours. When using the a JWT token the `/:tenant_id` of each API endpoints is inferred to be the authenticated token and is not necessary.
