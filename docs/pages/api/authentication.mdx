### Admin API Key

The API uses bearer token authentication with a token of your choice configured through the `API_KEY` environment variable.

### JWT Token

The API can also be authenticated using a per-tenant token that's valid for 24 hours. When using a JWT token, the `/:tenant_id` for each API endpoint is inferred from the authenticated token, and providing it in the path is not necessary.
